React Static Components
About this Build
You are half way through the course! You've been showing off your portfolio and projects to your friends, family and classmates and they all say "It's fine. I like it!" But you want more insight.

So you decide to look into some analytical tools...but wow! They are expensive! You decide to make your own.
